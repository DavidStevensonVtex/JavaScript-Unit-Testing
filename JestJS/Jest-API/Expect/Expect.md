# [Expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect)

When you're writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. expect gives you access to a number of "matchers" that let you validate different things.

TIP
For additional Jest matchers maintained by the Jest Community check out [jest-extended](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended).

INFO
The TypeScript examples from this page will only work as documented if you explicitly import Jest APIs:

> import {expect, jest, test} from '@jest/globals';

Consult the [Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript) guide for details on how to setup Jest with TypeScript.
