// expect.not.objectContaining(object)

// expect.not.objectContaining(object) matches any received object that does not recursively 
// match the expected properties. That is, the expected object is not a subset of the received 
// object. Therefore, it matches a received object which contains properties that are not 
// in the expected object.

// It is the inverse of expect.objectContaining.
